  - clsBinaryTreeNode: 
      - Creates Node class: A generic class that could be used for tree with a nodelist that could store N number of child objects
      - Creates NodeList class: A class that could store list of Nodes
      - Creates BinaryTreeNode class: A class that defines the structure of Binary Tree Node. Inherits from Node class

      - Actual BST class with BinaryTreeNode created
      - Properties: Root
      - Methods: Compare, Contains, Add, Inorder, Preorder, PostOrder traversal (non-recursive)
